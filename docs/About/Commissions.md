## Important Notes
- You will receive the source files for the project.
- I do not maintain your projects for you after completion of the commission.
- If you want me to work on a preexisting project; I'll only accept those files in the form of a `.unitypackage` for security. (Don't worry I can guide you through the process of exporting this.)
- I may choose too, but I'm not responsible for keeping backups of your project. Please keep your own backups.
- If you want me to use any paid assets then you must provide proof of purchase of all paid assets. (I can source my own copies, but most licenses require all parties to have purchased the asset.)
- **You are permitted three (3) revisions after development of the project has begun.** I may choose not to count some smaller/minimally destructive revisions. I get the final say as to what changes count to this total.
- **These prices are subject to change at any time.** I may choose to update these prices from time-to-time.
- **Final prices be different depending on the complexity.** If your project is more or less complex we may negotiate a lower or higher price.
- **All prices are in USD.**
- **Half of payment is expected upfront. Second Half is due at completion before the project files are provided.** Paying the full price early is permitted and greatly appreciated, but does not automatically grant expedited service.
