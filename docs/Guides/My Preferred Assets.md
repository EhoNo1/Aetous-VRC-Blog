Here's a general list (in no particular order) of various assets and asset stores I browse to find resources for my world projects:

**Note:** I use the phrase `"Free"` with quotes to mark assets that are *monetarily* free but may have contractual strings attached. Use your best judgement when deciding whether to use one of these.

- [3DAsset.One](https://3dassets.one) ("Free") - A general purpose "free" 3D asset search engine. Really good if you're searching for one specific thing. Be careful; it includes custom license and sign-up required assets.
- [AmbientCG](https://ambientcg.com/) (Free) - CC0 photorealistic materials. My go-to library for any materials I need for world geometry.
- [Bakery GPU Lightmapper](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/bakery-gpu-lightmapper-122218) (Paid) - A paid GPU Ray-tracing lightmapper, I find it generally has a more realistically accurate result than the built-in GPU lightmapper. It has a bit of a learning curve, but I personally prefer it. It's available from the Asset Store for a one time fee, and goes on sale often. It also doesn't have the minimum 4gb of VRAM requirement that the built-in GPU lightmapper has, so if you're building on an older machine with low VRAM then it might be your only option.
- [Beautiful Sky by RED_SIM](https://www.patreon.com/posts/beautiful-sky-35667377) (Paid) - An absolutely gorgeous realtime sky shader by RED_SIM. Just look at this one, trust me.
- [Poiyomi](https://www.poiyomi.com/) (Free & Paid) - Great general purpose special effect shader. Often used for avatars but includes a "world" option better suited for worlds. Lets you openly configure and experiment in realtime, then compiles down to a high performant version when VRChat goes to export. Free for everyone, but also offers a paid subscription with early access for supporters.
- [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/) (Free) - CC0 photoscanned objects, HDRIs, models, and materials.  Most of the models are made for renders, so will need reduction and cleanup for use in VRChat.
- [VR.Space Furniture Pack](https://vr.space/download/free-furniture-pack-2022/) (Free & Paid) - A free furniture set with models built for use in VRChat and VR Applications. There is also a paid version, expanded version of the pack (which I can't seem to find). Most of the furniture in my worlds winds up being from these packs.
