# Tools You'll Need
Now with the introductory stuff out of the way, lets get down to practical information! Note that this blog assumes you're using VRChat. Note that this is being written around late 2024 and VRChat and it's SDK are subject to change, and I might not always have the time to update the information here. If you run into errors, ask around and check the official [VRChat Creator Docs](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) and or the [general purpose documentation](https://docs.vrchat.com/).

Here's what you'll need (don't worry all of these are free):
- [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) (Also known as the VCC.) - micromanages project package updates and can even install the correct version of Unity for you.
- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub) - Micromanages your Unity installs, lets you add and remove platform export packages at any time. Requires a free Unity account. If the VCC ever has trouble installing Unity it might ask you to install it through Unity Hub. Great if you're also a Unity dev or need to export content for [ChilloutVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/661130/ChilloutVR/) or [VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu/), which may require different unique Unity versions.
- [Current supported version of the Unity Editor](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/upgrade/current-unity-version/) - Whatever version of 
- Preferred model editor with a `.FBX` export format. ([Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is recommended.)
- Preferred image/texture editor with `.PNG` export format ([Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/index.html) or [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) are recommended.)
- Windows OS - Yes. I know. I hate it too. But so far the most stable and only officially supported editor OS for VRChat is Windows. If you're a Linux daily driver, I'd advise just getting Windows disk just for this trust me, it's just not worth the headache.

The breadth of skills and disciplines that go into making virtual worlds is incredibly diverse, so your choice of tools will reflect what you're most comfortable with.

## Installation 
There are some installation gatchas that might trip you up or be inconvenient; here are some of my suggestions:

- I recommend first installing Unity Hub then the VCC, this way the VCC can call upon Unity Hub if it needs it.
- Install Blender through the **[website](https://www.blender.org/)** installer not through Steam (yes it's on Steam). Unity will automatically call upon Blender to export `.blend` files (and maybe a few other types of files) in your project to `.fbx` at import time. But Unity can struggle to identify Blender if it's installed through steam.
