### Changelog
- Acquired some royalty free music to ensure the game's *vibe* is up to the challenge. Huge shoutout to [Ovani Sound](https://ovanisound.com/) for making this even a possibility and [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) for helping it's sale raise money for charity.
- Removed existing split-screen multiplayer code for maintainability. Split-screen multiplayer is out of scope for now.
- Added Synthpop Music Pack Vol 1, "Sunset Strip" as generic Race Finish music.
- The non-CPU player finishing a race now triggers the Race Finish music.
- Added Electronic Music Pack Vol 4, "On A Mission" as Ventus Rush level BGM.
- Created custom `ItemBox` Model.
- Changed Item box collection sound to a glass shatter effect.
- Fixed a bug that stopped `ItemBox` collection sounds from playing.
- Fixed formatting errors in `ItemBox`.
- Added particles to `ItemBox` that increase with speed and blast in the player's movement direction.
