# Realtime Parameter Tracker
Realtime Parameter tracker is a standalone companion app for VRChat that enables you to puppet an avatar parameter over a long period of time, between sessions, in real-time. You can use it to simulate real transitions or effects over the course hours, days and months, with everything occurring in real-world time.

Imagine clothing that slowly morphs with the seasons, robots that slowly rust over months or years, or enabling your characters to transition over realtime-scales.

I've made an effort to make it as user friendly as possible, and I'll gladly add features as people request them over on the issue tracker!

## Where to get it
The app is available over on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/realtime-tracker-104552459) for a minimum of $5. (I won't be upset if you subscribe for only a month, but you'll need to be subscribed for future updates.)
