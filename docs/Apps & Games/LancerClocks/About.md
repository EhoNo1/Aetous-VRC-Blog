# Lancer Clocks
A friend of mine, [SuchDistantStars](https://www.twitch.tv/suchdistantstars) reached out and asked if I could make a custom clock indicator stream UI based on the [Lancer TTRPG](https://massifpress.com/lancer).

## How to Use
It's built so that you can simply run it in the background, tabbing over and updating it manually as needed. If you're using [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) you can use a [Chroma key filter](https://obsproject.com/kb/chroma-key-filter) to make the included green background transparent, and replace it with whatever you want in OBS. 

(Most modern streaming software should have this feature, if it does not, you can run OBS as a virtual camera output to perform the chroma keying and import it as a virtual webcam feed. It's open source, so you can use it for almost any purpose free of charge.)
## Licensing
You are welcome to use this webapp on both for-profit and non-profit streams. 

Attribution is requested and greatly appreciated, but not required. You can do so by simply adding something `Lancer clock display by TailTwistStudios` somewhere in your stream description, or anywhere you would normally place attributions.

If you're making enough money from streaming to spare I'd greatly appreciate a dollar or two. [Support Me!](/About/SupportMe/)
