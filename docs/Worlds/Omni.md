Forgotten Omni is a smaller oceanic world inspired in part by [Ocean Palace from Sonic Heroes](https://sonic.neoseeker.com/wiki/Ocean_Palace) with some other inspirations from my childhood. It's one of my highest detailed worlds, and much of the time it took to develop it was spent cleaning up assets and resources.

This time I had focused on a predominantly Blender based workflow, assembling the geometry for more or less the entire world in one blendfile then simply adding Unity and VRChat specific features on top.
