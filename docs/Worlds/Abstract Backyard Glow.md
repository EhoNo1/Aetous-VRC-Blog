Abstract Backyard Glow was the first world I made using my new (now moderately aged) laptop that I'm currently writing this on. I had originally planned on using it to find new multiplatform workflows, but that had proved to be more complicated than initially though.

The world tries to exhibit a sense of *unreality* with the energy of a suburban American backyard. The world itself floats in an endless open sky with decorative waterfalls of lawn beyond the latices.
