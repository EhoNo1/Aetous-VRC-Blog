# ISWM W2G
ISWM W2G is an unofficial [In Space With Markiplier](https://youtu.be/j64oZLF443g) viewing world for VRChat.

The world utilizes an [USharp Video](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo) being controlled by a custom written controller. 

All of the decisions and paths in the show are precached in-world then loaded dynamically using VRChat's provided Udon JSON libraries. 

All content is streamed by video streaming libraries built into VRChat.
