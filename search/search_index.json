Don't worry, from my opinion it's genuinely the easiest form of optimization to do in VRChat. It's reversible and is done by a single dropdown, seriously. If you can upload your own avatar you have all the skills you need to optimize your textures. The Quickest Tutorial You've Ever Seen In your avatar's unity project, browse to your textures and highlight them in the Project tab, this will open it's import settings in the Inspector tab. (You can bulk select textures if you'd like, just make sure you don't accidentally select a non-texture or else the inspector won't show anything.) Find the Max Size dropdown and change it to something realistic and then click apply. That's the whole tutorial. I'm serious. Don't forget to reupload your avatar when you're done! Example from the Meownyrn base from FrostKittyPaw. This number is the maximum size the texture will be allowed to be exported at. You can work on this texture at any size you like and keep it's original source file at any size you like . The only number that really matters is this Max Size setting. By default, Unity will set it to 2048 , this can be overridden by an avatar creator or by you if you need it. Personally I recommend going through your textures and lowering to the point just above you notice there's a difference in texture. If it's the texture of something tiny, like a ring, you might lower lower it to something like 256 or 128 . Use your best judgement, if you decide you need more you can always go back and raise it later. One more thing: do not use crunch compression. Why? Crunch compression uses a more aggressive and expensive compression algorithms to greatly reduce the exported file size. This exclusively saves file size and nothing else, in fact, the texture must the be decrunched on the receiving end before being loaded into VRAM at the same size it would have been without crunch compression . So you're not only not saving any VRAM, by using it you're increasing the resources it takes to load it in the first place. Is it dangerous? No! This is a nondestructive action, it can be reversed at any time, and doesn't touch the original file, only the copy of the original that gets exported and shows up in VRAM . What happens if I crank it too high? Unity won't scale up the texture beyond it's source resolution. So if you've set a 2k texture to be 8K, it won't magically make it higher resolution. Unity doesn't know how to add more detail, so it doesn't bother. But it will constrain it to the max resolution if the source file ever becomes a larger resolution.","title":"Avatar Texture Optimization"},{"location":"Guides/Avatar%20Texture%20Optimization/#avatar-texture-optimization","text":"Written: 5/2/2024 So if you're reading this, you've probably been suggested to optimize your avatar's textures.

Hello, and thank you for being here. My primary purpose of this guide is to help catalogue my techniques and skills, both for my own future reflection and to document and share these techniques for other who wish to get into making virtual worlds in VRChat and beyond. Forgive me but I'd like to infodump my thoughts, if you just want a tutorial, skip this section. A lot of art and creativity flourishes and dies by the privileges and access to resources by the artists that create it. The same way some people pontificate on the number of Albert Einsteins equivalents are being born into economic situations they can't thrive; so too do artists of all kinds. But we live in an age where access to the internet is ubiquitous for many, and it's arguably visibly on the horizon and in the air for those who desire it and don't yet have it. By sharing my knowledge about virtual world development, I can hand the tools I use to the people who need it for their own endeavors. 2. What to Expect First off I want to set expectations; like every form of art, you don't make virtual worlds to get rich. Some of you might find a way or get lucky, but it's never a given. You make art because you love it. Not for your family or friends, but for you alone . I've spent way to long grinding trying to strike it big, make content that will get me attention. All of it, and I do mean all of it has ultimately failed. Even some of my biggest successes and new accomplishments never felt like my accomplishments because I wasn't doing it for myself. Forgotten Cat Tree , one of my biggest successes took months of labor and burnout only to succeed and feel... meh, I didn't feel any proud of it. With that successful failure, I started making worlds just for myself, nobody else, and that started feeling much better. I went on to make Abstract Backyard Glow and that did moderately well and more or less stepped away from world making, it felt wrong, I was burnt out, and didn't want to do it anymore. Then one day, I made a joke with a friend and slapped together a VRChat meta shitpost world in under two hours one night before bed. And god damnit if that didn't make it through the VRChat Labs clout-gate in less than 48hrs with little to no marketing. In contrast with worlds I've spent 100s of hours working on, that really hurts. Which is why I say don't do this unless you genuinely want too. Don't let yourself get carried away, chasing arbitrary numbers and success for the sake of having something to show for it. Just make things because you enjoy making things. Create things to scratch that itch to create. If you don't feel like you have an itch to create, that's okay too. Usually that just means you haven't found the right medium for you or you just don't know how to stretch your muscles in the medium you've chosen. If you'd like further reading, Adam Savage's Every Tool's a Hammer (ISBN:9781982113476) is really one of my favorites to help ground myself surrounding my creative endeavors. 3. Tools You'll Need Now with the introductory stuff out of the way, lets get down to practical information! Note that this blog assumes you're using VRChat. Note that this is being written around late 2024 and VRChat and it's SDK are subject to change, and I might not always have the time to update the information here. If you run into errors, ask around and check the official VRChat Creator Docs and or the general purpose documentation . Here's what you'll need (don't worry all of these are free): VRChat Creator Companion (Also known as the VCC.) - micromanages project package updates and can even install the correct version of Unity for you. Unity Hub - Micromanages your Unity installs, lets you add and remove platform export packages at any time. Requires a free Unity account. If the VCC ever has trouble installing Unity it might ask you to install it through Unity Hub. Great if you're also a Unity dev or need to export content for ChilloutVR or VSeeFace , which may require different unique Unity versions. Current supported version of the Unity Editor - Whatever version of Unity VRChat's currently using. Preferred model editor with a .FBX export format. ( Blender is recommended.) Preferred image/texture editor with .PNG export format ( Paint.NET or Krita are recommended.) Windows OS - Yes. I know. I hate it too. But so far the most stable and only officially supported editor OS for VRChat is Windows. If you're a Linux daily driver, I'd advise just getting Windows disk just for this trust me, it's just not worth the headache. The breadth of skills and disciplines that go into making virtual worlds is incredibly diverse, so your choice of tools will reflect what you're most comfortable with. Installation There are some installation gatchas that might trip you up or be inconvenient; here are some of my suggestions: I recommend first installing Unity Hub then the VCC, this way the VCC can call upon Unity Hub if it needs it. Install Blender through the website installer not through Steam (yes it's on Steam). Unity will automatically call upon Blender to export .blend files (and maybe a few other types of files) in your project to .fbx at import time. But Unity can struggle to identify Blender if it's installed through steam.","title":"World Development"},{"location":"Guides/World%20Development/#world-development","text":"","title":"World Development"},{"location":"Guides/World%20Development/#why","text":"Hello, and thank you for being here.

The world utilizes an USharp Video being controlled by a custom written controller. All of the decisions and paths in the show are precached in-world then loaded dynamically using VRChat's provided Udon JSON libraries. All content is streamed by video streaming libraries built into VRChat. How It Works To the untrained eye; it looks like either a fan project or a cheap clout grab. But to the trained eye it seems like this shouldn't exist, and it almost didn't exist at all. For context In Space With Markiplier is a free YouTube Original comedy adventure show that features an interactive branching storyline . The show uses the platform universal YouTube Cards to enable the viewer(s) to make active decisions in the narrative making choices as their own character, \"The Captain\", in the show. Well that's interesting, but what if I want to watch it with my friends across the globe in VRChat? Well... as of making this world and as of writing this months after the fact; VRChat's video player system does not support YouTube Cards or metadata in any capacity. No thumbnails, no descriptions. Worst of all, VRChat's web query system doesn't support procedurally generated dynamic web requesting. All web requests must either be manually inserted by a user at runtime or permanently baked in-full into the world by the developer. In order for this show to work at all in VRChat, I had to make a custom solution from scratch. So I made custom solution from scratch. First, I needed to build a database. So using NodeJS running YT-DLP commands, I wrote a simple webcrawler to dynamically crawl the entirety of the show from start to finish, visiting every possible choice on every possible path, and building a non-linear linked list of the entire decision tree of the show (approximately 97 unique videos) and exporting it as a JSON file. Every node contained the title of the video, it's description, and it's unique ID and link. After some manual data integrity checking and cleanup, I used a second webcrawler to pre-download all the thumbnails of every video in the show so they could be baked into the VRChat world. After that I built a custom UdonSharp (modified Unity C# for VRChat) state machine that was capable of now tokenizing and navigating the decision tree linked-list at runtime in the VRChat Client while displaying fake YouTube cards onscreen for users to vote on and navigate the show. The state machine can pull the IDs of a particular video's choices and look up the thumbnails, and titles, by their ID and displaying them onscreen in the cards. There are also multiple sets of cards in configuration of 1-4 the state machine picks from to display the choices. But of course, VRChat's web query system can't dynamically load links that aren't baked into a world. But inks must be wrapped in a VRCURL container, who's constructor only exists in the Unity Editor . So I wrote a custom editor that will take a reference to the JSON file and with a button press creates and prefills an array with VRCURL s for every video in the show. That array then gets baked into the world and accessed by the controller at runtime to feed the video URLs into the player.","title":"ISWM W2G"},{"location":"Worlds/ISWM%20W2G/#iswm-w2g","text":"ISWM W2G is an unofficial In Space With Markiplier viewing world for VRChat.

But to the trained eye it seems like this shouldn't exist, and it almost didn't exist at all. For context In Space With Markiplier is a free YouTube Original comedy adventure show that features an interactive branching storyline . The show uses the platform universal YouTube Cards to enable the viewer(s) to make active decisions in the narrative making choices as their own character, \"The Captain\", in the show. Well that's interesting, but what if I want to watch it with my friends across the globe in VRChat? Well... as of making this world and as of writing this months after the fact; VRChat's video player system does not support YouTube Cards or metadata in any capacity. No thumbnails, no descriptions. Worst of all, VRChat's web query system doesn't support procedurally generated dynamic web requesting. All web requests must either be manually inserted by a user at runtime or permanently baked in-full into the world by the developer. In order for this show to work at all in VRChat, I had to make a custom solution from scratch.","title":"How It Works"},{"location":"Worlds/ISWM%20W2G/#so-i-made-custom-solution-from-scratch","text":"First, I needed to build a database. So using NodeJS running YT-DLP commands, I wrote a simple webcrawler to dynamically crawl the entirety of the show from start to finish, visiting every possible choice on every possible path, and building a non-linear linked list of the entire decision tree of the show (approximately 97 unique videos) and exporting it as a JSON file. Every node contained the title of the video, it's description, and it's unique ID and link.
