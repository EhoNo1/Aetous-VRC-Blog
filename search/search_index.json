If you have any questions please pop me an email over at Aetous@proton.me . And please read the Important Notes section before commissioning. World Commissions Optimization/Quest Porting Already got a world but don't want to bother or don't know how to port it to Quest? I got you! $ 50 Quest Porting From Scratch World Rooms $ 65 Small Room (1 Point of interest*) $125 Medium Size Room (2 points of interest*) $175 Large Room (3 Points of interest*) * Points of interest are singular spots or subsections of a room where people like to congregate. They can vary in size, but every point of interest can be expected to hold around 2-6 people. Environments $30 3D External environment. $FREE 2D Skybox (a free or CC0 asset found elsewhere). Code Commissions Need someone to write some Udon# code for you? I got you. Price varies depending on complexity, reach out to me and we'll figure out a price. Important Notes You will receive the source files for the project. I do not maintain your projects for you after completion of the commission. If you want me to work on a preexisting project; I'll only accept those files in the form of a .unitypackage for security. (Don't worry I can guide you through the process of exporting this.) I may choose too, but I'm not responsible for keeping backups of your project. Please keep your own backups. If you want me to use any paid assets then you must provide proof of purchase of all paid assets. (I can source my own copies, but most licenses require all parties to have purchased the asset.) You are permitted three (3) revisions after development of the project has begun. I may choose not to count some smaller/minimally destructive revisions. I get the final say as to what changes count to this total. These prices are subject to change at any time. I may choose to update these prices from time-to-time. Final prices be different depending on the complexity. If your project is more or less complex we may negotiate a lower or higher price. All prices are in USD. Half of payment is expected upfront. Second Half is due at completion before the project files are provided. Paying the full price early is permitted and greatly appreciated, but does not automatically grant expedited service.","title":"Commissions"},{"location":"Commissions/#commissions","text":"I make Optimize and Mobile friendly fully customizable VRC worlds.

Realtime Parameter tracker is a standalone companion app for VRChat that enables you to puppet an avatar parameter over a long period of time, between sessions, in real-time. You can use it to simulate real transitions or effects over the course hours, days and months, with everything occurring in real-world time. Imagine clothing that slowly morphs with the seasons, robots that slowly rust over months or years, or enabling your characters to transition over realtime-scales. I've made an effort to make it as user friendly as possible, and I'll gladly add features as people request them over on the issue tracker! Where to get it The app is available over on my Patreon for a minimum of $5. (I won't be upset if you subscribe for only a month, but you'll need to be subscribed for future updates.)","title":"Realtime Parameter Tracker!"},{"location":"Apps/Realtime%20Parameter%20Tracker/#realtime-parameter-tracker","text":"Realtime Parameter tracker is a standalone companion app for VRChat that enables you to puppet an avatar parameter over a long period of time, between sessions, in real-time.

Don't worry, from my opinion it's genuinely the easiest form of optimization to do in VRChat. It's reversible and is done by a single dropdown, seriously. If you can upload your own avatar you have all the skills you need to optimize your textures. The Quickest Tutorial You've Ever Seen In your avatar's unity project, browse to your textures and highlight them in the Project tab, this will open it's import settings in the Inspector tab. (You can bulk select textures if you'd like, just make sure you don't accidentally select a non-texture or else the inspector won't show anything.) Find the Max Size dropdown and change it to something realistic and then click apply. That's the whole tutorial. I'm serious. Don't forget to reupload your avatar when you're done! Example from the Meownyrn base from FrostKittyPaw. This number is the maximum size the texture will be allowed to be exported at. You can work on this texture at any size you like and keep it's original source file at any size you like . The only number that really matters is this Max Size setting. By default, Unity will set it to 2048 , this can be overridden by an avatar creator or by you if you need it. Personally I recommend going through your textures and lowering to the point just above you notice there's a difference in texture. If it's the texture of something tiny, like a ring, you might lower lower it to something like 256 or 128 . Use your best judgement, if you decide you need more you can always go back and raise it later. One more thing: do not use crunch compression. Why? Crunch compression uses a more aggressive and expensive compression algorithms to greatly reduce the exported file size. This exclusively saves file size and nothing else, in fact, the texture must the be decrunched on the receiving end before being loaded into VRAM at the same size it would have been without crunch compression . So you're not only not saving any VRAM, by using it you're increasing the resources it takes to load it in the first place. Is it dangerous? No! This is a nondestructive action, it can be reversed at any time, and doesn't touch the original file, only the copy of the original that gets exported and shows up in VRAM . What happens if I crank it too high? Unity won't scale up the texture beyond it's source resolution. So if you've set a 2k texture to be 8K, it won't magically make it higher resolution. Unity doesn't know how to add more detail, so it doesn't bother. But it will constrain it to the max resolution if the source file ever becomes a larger resolution.","title":"Avatar Texture Optimization"},{"location":"Guides/Avatar%20Texture%20Optimization/#avatar-texture-optimization","text":"Written: 5/2/2024 So if you're reading this, you've probably been suggested to optimize your avatar's textures.
