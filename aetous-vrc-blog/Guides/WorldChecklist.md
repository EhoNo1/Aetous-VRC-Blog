# World Checklist
Here is my general purpose checklist that I consider while I'm developing a world. 

Ideally you'll want to get your world out there and in front of people (while you're there to listen) as much as possible. So these aren't *TODOs* before release, but rather *nice-to-haves* while you're in the mid to late stages of active development on the world.
## Checklist
- [ ] Verify scale of everything in the world using scale models.
- [ ] **CALL TO ACTION** - 
- [ ] **ALWAYS** be able to jump
- [ ] Verify lightmaps are reasonably efficient
- [ ] Video Player
- [ ] Desktop Seats
- [ ] Verify texture density
- [ ] Avali flight (if applicable)
- [ ] Swimmable bodies of water
- [ ] Decorate skybox with billboards and low poly models
