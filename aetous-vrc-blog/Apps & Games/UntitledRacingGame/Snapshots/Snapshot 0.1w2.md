# Snapshot 0.1w2
**Published:** 9/14/2024

Oh Snap! (shot)

Shoutout to [Distractible](https://open.spotify.com/show/2X40qLyoj1wQ2qE5FVpA7x) podcast, I've been binge listening to them as background noise while I work. Not as much work on this weeks snapshot as I had hoped, but there's still a considerable amount. I recently got a set of drawing/animation reference figurines, so I'm looking to start developing some references for the future.

I'm also considering moving these snapshots to Thursday or Friday, rather than late Saturday, this way you all can more easily play this week's snapshot over the weekend!
