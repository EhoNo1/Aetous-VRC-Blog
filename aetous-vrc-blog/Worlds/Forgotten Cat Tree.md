Forgotten Cat Tree was my first ever world to break out of VRChat Labs. Before it I had spend years (after realizing my Unity skills were actually useful for something) building small worlds that looked like shit. 

I had made meetup worlds, memes, attempted to make a couple game worlds but didn't get far. Nothing worked.

I was at the end of my rope as a VRChat artist. There was an unshakable aura that I, after years of effort, had be more or less forgotten as a creator. That's where the "Forgotten" name comes from. It's a self deprecatory acknowledgement that my work just might go unappreciated and be forgotten to time.

I had burned myself out. After a brutal month long grind I just completely gave up. My friends however did not. They continued promoting it after I had thrown in the towel. A couple of them distributed my world on VRC world hopping and photography communities, blasting the worlds popularity well over the threshold and to this day it is still my most visited world of all time.
